# AI-Regression-Models
This code performs linear regression to make predictions on two datasets using libraries numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. It utilizes a cubic function, mean square error loss function, and gradient descent to identify optimal parameters. 2D and 3D scatter plots of the original data and the predictions are then created for both datasets.
